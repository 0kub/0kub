### Hello! My name is cub.
And i'm currently teaching php and html, and making some websites like Brick-Hell.

- What i working on? - Some sources, i using them to teach these "php" and "html".
- I'm not particularly working on something important, but I always try to help someone, or make a new project that will always be annoying.

And.. i am a mistake that makes more mistakes.
